<p>Hansen was sitting at the control board in the single
building on Communications Relay Station 43.4SC, when the
emergency light flashed on for the first time in two hundred
years.</p>

<p>With textbook-recommended swiftness, he located the position
of the ship sending

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

the call, identified the ship and the name of its captain,
and made contact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Hansen on 43.4SC. Put me through to Captain
Fromer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fromer here,&rdquo; said an incredible deep voice,
&ldquo;what the devil do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I want?&rdquo; asked the astonished Hansen.
&ldquo;It was you, sir, who sent the emergency call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did no such thing,&rdquo; said Fromer with great
certainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the light flashed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been out of school?&rdquo; Fromer
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost a year, sir, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the
fact that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re imagining things and that
you&rsquo;ve been sitting on that asteroid hoping that
something would happen to break the monotony. Now leave me
the hell alone or I&rsquo;ll put you on report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; Hansen began, practically
beside himself with frustration, &ldquo;I saw that emergency
light go on. Maybe it was activated automatically when
something went out of order on your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow emergencies on the Euclid
Queen,&rdquo; said Fromer with growing anger. &ldquo;Now, if
you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hansen spared himself the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

indignity of being cut off. He broke contact himself. He
sighed, reached for a book entitled <i>Emergency Procedure
Rules</i>, and settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the emergency light flashed on for the
second time in two hundred years. With its red glow
illuminating his freckled excited face, Hansen triumphantly
placed another call to the Euclid Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Hansen on 43.4SC. Let me speak to Captain
Fromer, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;the Captain has asked me to contact you.
I&rsquo;m the navigator. I was just about to call you. We
have a small problem that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to the Captain,&rdquo; Hansen
repeated grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here. I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of handling
this situation. Actually, it&rsquo;s hardly even an
emergency. You were, it seems, signaled automatically
when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll check your emergency
procedures,&rdquo; Hansen said, holding his thumb in the
Rule Book, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll note that the Relay Station
Attendant contacts the Captain personally during all
emergencies. Of course, if you want to violate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, old man,&rdquo; said the navigator, now
sounding on the verge of tears, &ldquo;try to realize the
spot I&rsquo;m in. Fromer has ordered me to handle this
thing without his assistance. He seems to feel that you have
a grudge of some kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t put me in touch with Captain
Fromer in five minutes, I&rsquo;ll put through a call to
Sector Headquarters.&rdquo; Hansen signaled off contact. If
he knew nothing else about the situation, he knew that he
had the upper hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five minutes later Captain Fromer called him back. &ldquo;I
am calling in accordance with emergency procedures,&rdquo;
Fromer said between clinched teeth. &ldquo;The situation is
this: We are reporting an emergency&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What class emergency?&rdquo; Hansen interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Class?&rdquo; asked Fromer, obviously caught off
guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain. There are three classes of emergencies.
Major class, which would include death and injury.
Mechanical class, including malfunction of Hegler units and
such. And General class&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course, General class by all
means,&rdquo; Fromer said hurriedly. &ldquo;You see,
it&rsquo;s hardly even an emergency. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what is the nature of the trouble,
Captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, uh, well it seems that we were doing a
preliminary landing procedure check, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, er, it seems that we can&rsquo;t get the door
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Hansen&rsquo;s turn to be taken aback.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling my leg, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly am not,&rdquo; Captain Fromer said
emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really mean that you can&rsquo;t open the
door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. Something&rsquo;s wrong with the
mechanism. Our technical staff has never encountered a
problem like this, and they advise me that any attempt at
repair might possibly result in the opposite
situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean not being able to get the door
closed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely. In other words, we can&rsquo;t
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Then I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s nothing I
can do except advise Sector Headquarters to send an
emergency repair crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Fromer sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, too. How
long will it take for a message to get there with your
transmitting equipment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two days, Captain. At a guess, there&rsquo;ll be a
ship alongside within the week. You&rsquo;ll be maintaining
your present position, I assume?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be here, all right,&rdquo; Fromer
said bitterly. Then he cut contact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the single occupant of a large asteroid with nothing but
time and boredom on his hands, Hansen was enjoying the whole
situation immensely. He allowed himself the luxury of
several dozen fantasies in which his name was mentioned
prominently in galaxy-wide reports of the episode. He
imagined that Captain Fromer was also creating vivid
accounts&mdash;of quite another sort&mdash;that would soon be amusing
several hundred billion news-hungry citizens of the
Federation.</p>

<p>When the repair ship arrived, it came, to Hansen&rsquo;s
astonishment, to the asteroid, and not alongside
Fromer&rsquo;s ship. He soon found out that there was
someone else who shared the Captain&rsquo;s embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bullard,&rdquo; said a tall, thin, mournful
man. &ldquo;Mind if I sit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; Hansen waved a hand toward the
meager accommodations. He had no idea why a Senior Engineer
was being so deferential, but he enjoyed the feeling of
power.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably wondering about a lot of
things,&rdquo; Bullard began sadly. &ldquo;Frankly, we
don&rsquo;t have any ideas about how we can fix Captain
Fromer&rsquo;s door.&rdquo; He waited to let that sink in.
Then he continued: &ldquo;It took us three days back at the
base to find out that when these ships were built, almost
five hundred years ago, nobody bothered to include detail
drawings of the door mechanism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why? You certainly know how to build&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know how to build Star Class ships, sure.
We&rsquo;ve built a few in the past century or two.
There&rsquo;s never been need for replacement, really. These
ships are designed to last forever. The original fleet was
conceived to fill the System&rsquo;s needs for a full
thousand years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the doors on the few ships that have been built.
How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve built were exact
duplicates of Captain Fromer&rsquo;s ship&mdash;except for the
door.&rdquo; Bullard&rsquo;s long face radiated despair.
&ldquo;No one ever questioned why the door mechanism
wasn&rsquo;t included in the original plans. We simply
designed another type&mdash;a different type&mdash;of door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly can find out how this particular
door works, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Bullard said, wringing his hands.
&ldquo;But we have a couple of other problems. Number one,
Captain Fromer has an extremely important passenger aboard.
None other than His Exalted Excellency, R&rsquo;thagna Bar.
He is&mdash;or was&mdash;on his way home after concluding a treaty of
friendship with the President of the Federation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hansen managed a whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; Bullard continued, &ldquo;His
Excellency <i>has to be home soon</i> to get there in time for
the mating season. This occurs once in a lifetime, I&rsquo;m
told, and this is his only chance to continue the ancestral
rule&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Hansen said. &ldquo;Are you
trying to say that you can&rsquo;t solve a simple problem
like getting him home and getting him out of the ship? You
can always cut it in two, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These ships were made to last forever,&rdquo; Bullard
explained. &ldquo;The hull is, of course, pseudo-met, but,
not the kind of pseudo-met used for other applications. In
short, about the only way you&rsquo;ll get in that ship is
to vaporize it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you simply disassemble the door
mechanism? My God, how complicated can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try to do just that,&rdquo;
Bullard said without a trace of confidence. &ldquo;As far as
the complication goes, let me say just this: it&rsquo;s full
of moving parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo; Hansen asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this. These ships are perfect mechanisms. There
is hardly anything in them that could be called a moving
part. Now a door has to open and close. Sure, we devised a
simple, safe way to do it a few hundred years after the
original fleet was built. The men who designed the original
door mechanism felt, perhaps, that it was incongruous to
include it in the first place. Maybe that is why they threw
away the plans. God knows, it is incongruous. Look!
Here&rsquo;s a photo we took of one in a ship back at
base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hansen scanned the photograph. It was a meaningless jumble.
He handed it back. &ldquo;Well, make yourself at home.
I&rsquo;m afraid that the only thing I can help with will be
radio communication to Captain Fromer&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; Bullard said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
expecting someone else tomorrow. After you bring him down,
feel free to drop over and see me anytime.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bullard went back to his ship, and Hansen went to bed. He
dreamed of His Exalted Excellency R&rsquo;thagna Bar,
growing angrier day by day as the time of mating came
closer. In his dream he suddenly came upon a magnificent
solution to the problem, a solution involving a telepathic
system of fertilization. He woke up before he had completely
worked out the details.</p>

<p>Bullard&rsquo;s friend arrived the same morning. He was a
small, dark active little man whom Hansen immediately
disliked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet Dr. Quemos,&rdquo; Bullard said when Hansen
dropped in on them. &ldquo;Dr. Quemos is a specialist in the
history of technology. He thinks he knows how our cute
little door mechanism is made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say for sure,&rdquo; Quemos said,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d guess that those components are made of
metal&mdash;real metal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that metal was used only in jewelry,&rdquo;
Hansen said.</p>

<p>Dr. Quemos grinned slyly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what most
people think. Actually, refined metal of various types was
used in large masses, formed masses, for thousands of years.
Historically speaking, the pseudo-mets are relatively
new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine metal functioning as
machinery,&rdquo; Hansen mused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say that this door mechanism has moving
parts, lots of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving parts are nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo;
Quemos said. &ldquo;Here, look at this.&rdquo; He put
something small on the table, much in the manner of a young
boy dropping a garter snake in the midst of school girls.
Bullard and Hansen crowded around. &ldquo;Now, take
turns,&rdquo; said Quemos sharply, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
drop it. It&rsquo;s priceless, I assure you.&rdquo; The
ancient wrist watch with its transparent back was passed
from hand to hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightening little monster, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo;
Bullard said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those small round wheels are called gears,&rdquo;
elucidated Quemos, &ldquo;one gear turns another, which
turns another, and so on. I rather imagine that your door is
operated on some similar principle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to be the one who asks all the schoolboy
questions,&rdquo; Hansen began, &ldquo;would somebody tell
me why Captain Fromer doesn&rsquo;t take His Excellency to
his home planet, land the ship, and then let his technical
staff tear off the door mechanism?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone through that,&rdquo; Bullard said
wearily. &ldquo;Unfortunately we need special tools. And
there&rsquo;s no way to get them into the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I speak to Captain Fromer?&rdquo; Quemos asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; Hansen said. He pressed his hand
in various patterns on his belt. &ldquo;This is Hansen. Let
us talk to Captain Fromer, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fromer here. Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Quemos speaking. How is your passenger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My passenger is fine. But he keeps telling me that he
is very anxious to plant his seed. When can you get us out
of here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plant his seed?&rdquo; said Quemos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing salacious about this,
I&rsquo;ve been assured. He simply has a biological craving
at this time in his life to&mdash;to plant his seed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got problems like that, too,&rdquo; Bullard said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t go around telling everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Stop clowning,&rdquo; Fromer snapped, &ldquo;you guys
better find a way to fix this damn door or you&rsquo;ll have
a galactic war on your hands. Anybody have any ideas
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure that the door mechanism is made of
metal,&rdquo; Quemos said, &ldquo;and the construction is
probably based on the principal of a worm gear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A worm gear, Captain,&rdquo; Quemos said patiently.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ancient metal device that was sometimes
used for closing large doors. There is also the possibility
that the door is closed and opened by dogs. These seem to
have been used, at least, to operate doors of undersea
crafts. Although we&rsquo;re not quite certain about the
function of dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain maintained a stony silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; Quemos continued, &ldquo;we have
unearthed, so to speak, a reference to a metal component
called a babbitt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here!&rdquo; Captain Fromer roared,
&ldquo;who do you think you&rsquo;re kidding with this talk
about worms, dogs and rabbits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Babbitts, Captain, babbitts! Perhaps a type of
bearing. Anyway, we&rsquo;re at work on the problem, I
assure you.&rdquo; Quemos motioned to Hansen that he was
through talking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the next three days, Hansen twice visited Bullard
and Quemos. On each occasion, he found the two men in
trance-like conditions, ostensibly thinking through the
problem that they had been assigned to solve, but more
probably, Hansen guessed, brooding about the reaction of
Sector Headquarters to their daily progress reports which
Hansen had been relaying for them. Hansen had only sympathy
for the people back at Sector Headquarters, for if these two
experts were the Galaxy&rsquo;s two top trouble-shooters,
the Federation, was not, as Hansen put it to himself, in
very good shape to fight a war with one hundred billion
enraged citizens who worshiped His Exalted Excellency
R&rsquo;thagna Bar almost as much as they did his seed.</p>

<p>Hansen went back to his reading, only to be interrupted with
increasing frequency by message transmissions from an
increasingly alarmed Sector Headquarters. Most messages were
addressed to Bullard, and were bravely designed to disguise
the senders&rsquo; hysteria, while at the same time urging
Bullard on to more magnificent efforts. A few messages,
fairly representative of the state of affairs as time wore
on reflected an increasing suspicion on the part of Sector
Headquarters that Quemos and Bullard, although certainly
tops in their fields, were not tops enough.</p>

<p>It went on like this for several more days. Hansen, at
first amused, was now alarmed and completely convinced that
both Quemos and Bullard were thoroughly useless. The
messages were his only source of information, since both
&ldquo;experts&rdquo; were too immersed in their work to
talk with him. As his alarm grew, he decided that he might
at least try to strike up a friendship with someone on board
Captain Fromer&rsquo;s sealed ship&mdash;someone who might have
something comforting to report. He called up the
ship&rsquo;s navigator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Hansen. How&rsquo;re things going up
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean? Good or bad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; the navigator said, while yawning,
&ldquo;that things are falling apart rapidly. In fact, in a
day or two I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll make much
difference whether or not they open that damn door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, er, care to fill me in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the navigator, with the voice
of a man who knows that it is too late for anything to
matter. &ldquo;The members of the crew are divided into two
factions. It appears that our physician has rallied half the
crew to support his medical contention that our exhalted
passenger belongs in the refrigerator. The good captain,
with some justice, one must admit, thinks that he is in
command of the ship, and prefers to believe that
R&rsquo;thagna Bar belongs out of the refrigerator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who seems to be winning the argument?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Argument? There&rsquo;s no argument, old
man&mdash;it&rsquo;s open warfare. No weapons aboard, of course,
but the two teams are grappling up and down the corridors
and shuttling our exhalted passenger in and out of the ice
box about four times each hour. Quite a sight, really. Right
now he&rsquo;s <i>in</i> the refrigerator, but the other
team&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me know who&rsquo;s ahead from time to time, will
you?&rdquo; Hansen heard himself say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to oblige,&rdquo; the navigator said, yawning
again. &ldquo;Oh, incidentally, have they sent for help
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hansen said with some surprise, &ldquo;Why, as a matter of
fact, Sector Headquarters is sending some help. How did you
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bound to happen sooner or later, old man. When the
going really gets tough they always get around to sending a
Gypsy. Only way to get anything done, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hansen said reluctantly.
&ldquo;Why is it that everyone knows except me? What,
please, is a Gypsy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young to know everything, old
man,&rdquo; the navigator said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
especially too young to know about one of the
Federation&rsquo;s best kept secrets. But you might as well,
I suppose. The fact is that a Gypsy is a generally vagrant,
dirty, thieving, clever scoundrel who will not work, who has
absolutely no respect for order or authority, who believes
that our institutions are effete and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, patience,&rdquo; cautioned the navigator,
haughtily, &ldquo;if I am to reveal everything I know, I
must do it in my own way. The description I just gave you is
not necessarily true. It is simply the way that Sector
Headquarters feels about Gypsies. Common jealousy, really.
It seems that from time to time, our perfect little galactic
society spawns men who don&rsquo;t care to be cast in the
common mold. In short, there are a few men around with
brains who don&rsquo;t think that it means very much to wear
pretty uniforms or fancy titles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uniforms like yours?&rdquo; asked Hansen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; the navigator said sadly.
&ldquo;The truth of the matter is, of course, that I only
play at being a navigator. I couldn&rsquo;t get this ship
off course, if I tried. The same is true with the four
engineering officers who stand around watching the Hegler
drive units. They occasionally make a ceremonial adjustment,
but beyond that, they simply stand around looking
pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No moving parts.&rdquo; Hansen said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No moving brains, if you like. Anyway, a Gypsy
has&mdash;somewhere along the line&mdash;learned how to do things.
They&rsquo;ll take an emergency call about once a year&mdash;if
they happen to feel like it. Then they charge about half a
million credits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean they have an organization, standard rates
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens no!&rdquo; the navigator said. &ldquo;They
hate anything that smells like organization. They
don&rsquo;t even specialize in any certain kind of work. One
year they&rsquo;ll be fascinated by sub-nucleonics, the next
by horse racing. Very erratic. Can&rsquo;t keep attention on
any one thing. Heard of one once who engaged in fishing and
alcohol drinking. Brilliant mathematician, too. But
he&rsquo;d only take a call once every three years or
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a half million credits a crack, eh? You could
live pretty well for three years on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strangely enough,&rdquo; the navigator said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t really have any
interest in money. If you&rsquo;d ever met one, you&rsquo;d
know that the high fee is sort of a penalty they mete out to
everyone else for being so dumb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing for sure,&rdquo; Hansen said,
&ldquo;if Bullard and Quemos are the cream of the crop,
I&rsquo;m on the side of the Gypsies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, youth!&rdquo; the navigator said, &ldquo;I, too,
once had such dreams&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about the dreams,&rdquo; Hansen said,
almost menacingly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t spend six years in
that damn school just to sit around in a pretty uniform for
the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get used to it. In fact,
you&rsquo;ll like it after a while. The home leaves. The
fuss your friends will make over you when you step off the
ship. The regular and automatic promotions in grade with the
extra gold band added to your sleeve; the move from one
outpost to an always larger installation. You&rsquo;ll never
do much, of course, but why should you? After all, there
aren&rsquo;t any moving parts.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hansen cut the communicator off. He stood there for a
moment, feeling depressed and betrayed. Automatically he
reached down and flicked imaginary dust from his blue sleeve
with its narrow solitary gold band. Ten minutes later the
Gypsy&rsquo;s ship signaled for landing.</p>

<p>The man who walked into Hansen&rsquo;s control room was
hardly the ogre he had been prepared for. He looked, Hansen
was later to reflect, like Santa Claus with muscles in place
of the fat. Wearing an almost unheard of beard and dressed
in rough clothes, he walked across the room and made short
work of the usual formalities. &ldquo;Name&rsquo;s
Candle,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s those two
phonies I&rsquo;m supposed to replace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go suit up and go back through
the airlock,&rdquo; Hansen said, motioning to the door.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in their ship. It&rsquo;s the one next
to yours. Want me to tell them you&rsquo;re on your way
over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell, no,&rdquo; said Candle, grinning,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surprise &rsquo;em. Now, suppose you and
me sit down and have a little chat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat and Candle pumped Hansen of everything he knew
about the entire situation. An hour later, Hansen felt
almost as if he had been had. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he
asked, wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got the facts,&rdquo; Candle said. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s go throw those experts out.&rdquo; It
wasn&rsquo;t quite that simple. Neither Bullard nor Quemos
had any intention of simply clearing out. &ldquo;Who the
hell you think you are,&rdquo; Bullard said, &ldquo;to come
over here and order us off? We didn&rsquo;t even ask for
help. And, God knows, you couldn&rsquo;t supply it
anyway.&rdquo; Bullard, with evident distaste, ran his eyes
up and down Candle&rsquo;s clothing.</p>

<p>Dr. Quemos had some ideas, too. &ldquo;Letter of authority
or no letter of authority,&rdquo; Quemos said, pointing a
manicured forefinger at the paper in Candle&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll ruin everything! You have no idea what
you&rsquo;re up against. We&rsquo;t spent weeks working
this thing out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candle grinned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ve you worked out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why we know that this is a metal double
enveloping worm gear.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; Candle said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
single enveloping worm gear. It&rsquo;s made of steel with
an aluminum alloy wheel gear and the two parts have corroded
and stuck. The whole mechanism was originally designed for
submarines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quemos started to say something, then turned and looked at
Bullard for reassurance. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo;
Bullard said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s making it up as he goes
along. How could he possibly know what he&rsquo;s talking
about? Why, there haven&rsquo;t been any submarines for
centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of playing games,&rdquo; Candle said,
no longer grinning. &ldquo;The boy and I have work to do.
You two are in the way. You&rsquo;ll only take up time if I
have to work with you and show you what to do. I want you
and your ship out of here in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to make us?&rdquo; Bullard asked
with great originality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody turned around to see who else had entered the
conversation. It was Hansen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give
you fifteen minutes, not thirty,&rdquo; Hansen said.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to turn the grid power on at
full intensity. You can either use it to take off, or sit
around and roast alive inside your ship.&rdquo; Candle
turned and looked at Hansen with new respect. &ldquo;Okay
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let&rsquo;s go back to your place. I&rsquo;ve still got
some things to figure out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quemos was on the verge of hysteria. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
bluffing! You wouldn&rsquo;t dare. I&rsquo;ll report
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, the ship headed for space.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Back in Hansen&rsquo;s room, the two men ate a quick lunch,
then sat at the table and talked about Candle&rsquo;s plans
for opening the reluctant door. &ldquo;The way I figure
it,&rdquo; Candle said, &ldquo;I think that we can handle
the whole thing by radio. Which reminds me, one of these
days I&rsquo;m going to build a telescreen that will
transmit and receive through pseudo-met. Not too difficult
really if you approach the problem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I better get Fromer for you,&rdquo; Hansen said
hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fromer here,&rdquo; said the bass voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Candle. Let me talk to one of your so-called
engineering officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the hell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up and go get &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Candle growled
back. &ldquo;And one more yelp out of you and you&rsquo;ll
stay in that ship till you rot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Fromer again, a meek Fromer.
&ldquo;My chief engineering officer is with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. Now get this. Come to think of it, you&rsquo;d
better record it. Number one: By now you know which
component is a worm gear. You will notice, I&rsquo;m quite
certain, that it engages a large notched wheel. The reason
that the door will not move is because at the point where
the two gears meet, some of the metal has oxidized. For
possible use in future emergencies, I offer this
explanation. The entire mechanism is subject to periodic
vacuum, when the airlock door is operated. In between times,
the mechanism is in the ship&rsquo;s atmosphere. A condition
of lower oxygen content thus obtains around the sealed off
area, and such an area is anodic&mdash;in other words, corrodible
with respect to the surrounding areas in which oxygen has
free access. Now, since this door has opened and closed
successfully for about five hundred years, it appears that
there&rsquo;s a special reason why it suddenly refuses to
function. At a guess, you would experience this condition of
intense corrosion only when the aluminum in the wheel gear
is exposed to something like sodium hydroxide, and only at
the point where it controls the worm gear. Now, has this
ship landed recently within such an atmosphere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three weeks ago on Ghortin IV,&rdquo; said the weak
voice of the engineer. &ldquo;We landed to get some pictures
of the cloud formations for souvenirs. We dropped on the
edge of a large body of water because the view was
better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Candle shook his head sadly and said, &ldquo;You could have
avoided trouble by coming in over the land instead of the
water. The heat from the ship boiled the water which
undoubtedly contained sodium carbonate and calcium
hydroxide; presto, and the air was filled with clouds of
sodium hydroxide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suggest that you steer away from all such wicked
places in the future. Of course, if you&rsquo;d learn how to
mine ore, smelt metal, machine components&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First they&rsquo;d have to discover fire,&rdquo;
Hansen said out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re catching on, son,&rdquo; Candle said,
out of the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, to
open the door it will be necessary to break the corroded
area apart. This is a large heavy mechanism, as such things
go. Since you have no tools heavy enough to batter the
corroded area apart, you&rsquo;ll have to make some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Candle sighed. &ldquo;I wish I had time to teach you to
think, but instead, you&rsquo;ll have to do as I tell you to
do. I think you can probably make a battering ram out of
water. You just&mdash;don&rsquo;t interrupt&mdash;find or make a long
cylindrical container, fill it with water and quick-freeze
it in your refrigerator&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they put R&rsquo;thagna Bar in the refrigerator
again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest you get him the hell out,&rdquo;
Candle said.</p>

<p>An hour later ten men smashed a half-ton cylinder of ice
against the corroded junction of the two gears. Following
Candle&rsquo;s instructions, they next applied the ram to
the door itself, which smoothly swung open.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find,&rdquo; Candle explained,
&ldquo;that the only damage will be the two missing teeth on
the aluminum gear. Since only two teeth are ever in contact
at any time, you can simply slide the gear forward and
engage it at a point where the teeth are intact.
You&rsquo;ll find, I&rsquo;m quite sure, that your door will
function properly. Also, Captain, don&rsquo;t pull out of
here until I&rsquo;m aboard. I think I&rsquo;d like to
bring an assistant along, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An assistant?&rdquo; Hansen asked.</p>

<p>Candle twirled the ends of his long white moustache.
&ldquo;You, my lad, if you&rsquo;d like to go along.&rdquo;
He pulled a letter from his pocket and fanned the air with
it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in complete command of this
expedition&mdash;at least until His Exalted Excellency gets home
to plant his seed.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hansen&rsquo;s face glowed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of
anything I&rsquo;d rather do. Let&rsquo;s get a couple of
messages off to Sector Headquarters and get on board
ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be any joy ride,&rdquo; Candle said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;You probably haven&rsquo;t heard about
it, but there&rsquo;ve been a number of ship emergencies in
the past few weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Door failures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. At least none that I&rsquo;ve heard of. But at
least two Hegler drives have stopped working in mid
space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, but there&rsquo;s nothing to stop
working&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candle&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;No moving parts,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hansen reddened. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ve outgrown that
silly notion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Candle peered into Hansen&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you have. I&rsquo;m sure that you will find out a lot
more things for yourself. You&rsquo;re the kind. And
we&rsquo;re going to need a lot of your kind, because
failures&mdash;failures of so-called perfect mechanisms&mdash;are
becoming more and more commonplace.&rdquo; Candle pointed to
the emergency light on the traffic control panel.
&ldquo;That light will be flashing with more and more
frequency in the months to come. But not just to signal
trouble in space. If I were a superstitious man, I&rsquo;d
think that the age of the perfect machine is about to be
superseded by the age of the perfect failure&mdash;mechanical
failures that can&rsquo;t be explained on any level. I have
several friends who&rsquo;ve been in touch with me recently
about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think that it&rsquo;s time for a change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candle smiled quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. And the
truth of the matter is that I <i>am</i> a superstitious man. I
really believe, childishly, that the mechanics and motions
of the galaxy may turn themselves upsidedown just to snap
man out of his apathy and give him some work to do.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upsidedown turned out to be a good word. They boarded the
big ship an hour later and were respectfully ushered into
the presence of Captain Fromer and his staff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re underway,&rdquo; Captain Fromer said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be landing in nine days to deliver
R&rsquo;thagna Bar home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Hansen asked.</p>

<p>Fromer shrugged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been thawed out, frozen,
and thawed out so many times, it&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s
guess. Take a look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone pulled back a curtain to expose the recumbent,
thawing, steamy form of His Exhalted Excellency
R&rsquo;thagna Bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s he undressed?&rdquo; Hansen asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny, now that you mention it,&rdquo; Fromer said,
puzzled, &ldquo;why <i>is</i> he undressed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fascinating! Damnedest thing I&rsquo;ve ever
seen,&rdquo; Candle said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so fascinating?&rdquo; Fromer asked
suspiciously, moving closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His belly. Never saw anything like it. Those black
squares keep appearing and disappearing. If I&rsquo;ve ever
seen a truly random pattern&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It started right after they froze him the first
time,&rdquo; Fromer said disconsolately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fascinating, by Heaven,&rdquo; said Candle, who was
now down on his hands and knees. &ldquo;Look at that top
sequence! Random, yet physiological. I&rsquo;ve got a friend
on Bridan III who&rsquo;d trade anything for some photos of
this. Get me some photo equipment, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Fromer ran his hands through what was left of his
hair. &ldquo;Get him some photo equipment,&rdquo; he said to
no one in particular, &ldquo;and somebody make a truce with
that idiot doctor long enough to get me a sedative.&rdquo;
About this time the ship turned upsidedown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no reason for it!&rdquo; the chief
engineer said, running alongside Hansen and Candle.
&ldquo;The ship can&rsquo;t turn upsidedown. Everything is
functioning perfectly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really not interested,&rdquo; said Candle, running
down the corridor&rsquo;s mile-long ceiling. &ldquo;Figure
something out for yourself for a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said
Hansen, dutifully trotting alongside, &ldquo;is how you knew
with such certainty how the door mechanism was made. Even if
submarines <i>were</i> built like that, you&rsquo;d have no way
of knowing. There haven&rsquo;t been any submarines in
centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hell you say,&rdquo; said Candle, increasing his
pace, &ldquo;I built one five years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Built one! What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the hell of it, and it was a damned good outfit,
too. I found plans in an old museum, and had the good sense
not to improve on &rsquo;em. Always remember, boy, that
something that really works can&rsquo;t be improved.
That&rsquo;s why the submarine mechanism was adopted&mdash;not
adapted&mdash;for space. The so-called &lsquo;better way&rsquo;
they&rsquo;re building &rsquo;em today is simply a disguise
for the fact that most of the gas is gone from our
technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to the submarine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I traded it to a friend for some falcons. You
interested in falconry by any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er, no. Can&rsquo;t say that I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; Candle said prophetically,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll succumb to every enthusiasm man has ever
been deviled with. You&rsquo;re the type. It&rsquo;s a
disease, boy, and the big symptom isn&rsquo;t just
curiosity, but the kind of intense curiosity that turns you
inside out, devours you and ruins you for orthodoxy.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hansen had stopped listening. He was absorbed in trying to
recall the pattern he had pressed on his radio belt&mdash;a
pattern never taught to him&mdash;when the ship had suddenly
turned upsidedown. Hesitantly, he played with the notion
that he had been <i>thinking</i> of the ship traveling upsidedown
at the time he impressed the novel pattern <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>on the belt.
Now, could that have possibly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?</p>

<p>The man and the boy disappeared down the ceiling, running at
top speed to catch up as the rapidly vanishing form of
R&rsquo;thagna Bar was dragged and pulled relentlessly
toward the refrigerator in a tug of war between the
ship&rsquo;s wild, divided crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fascinating!&rdquo; said Candle. His eyes, glittering
with their own peculiar madness, remained riveted on the
distant imperial belly. &ldquo;Never saw anything like
it!&rdquo;</p>
